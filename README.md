### Analyzing and modeling Seattle Airbnb listings data

1- motivations 
This project was conducted as part of udacity's Data scientist nanodegree. Data from Airbnb property listings in the city of Seattle in 2016 was aquired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?rvi=1" target="blank">Kaggle</a>. We implemented the data science process and answered 3 important questions that we think could benefit stakeholders and decision makers.
