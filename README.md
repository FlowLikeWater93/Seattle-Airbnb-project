# Analyzing and modeling Seattle Airbnb listings data
<br>
This project was conducted as part of udacity's Data scientist nanodegree
<br><br>
Data of Airbnb property listings in the city of Seattle in 2016 was aquired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?rvi=1" target="blank">Kaggle</a>
<br><br>
We went through the data science process in details, assesed, cleaned, analyzed the data and answered 3 important questions that we think could benefit stakeholders and decision makers
<br><br>

### Questions:
Q1) What is the percentage of hosts that made 35K USD from their properties in seattle in 2016 ?  
Q2) Do superhosts have a higher booking rate ? 
<br>
Q3) Can we predict If a new host has the poteintial to be a superhost from the limited avaialabe data ?  
<br>
